Lesson 6: Implicit rows

.container {
    grid-auto-rows: 100px;
}

// The piece of code above plays its role as a "uniform" for rows.
// In details, it will set the height of all rows to a specified figure, in this case, 100px
regardless of how many rows we have.
// Therefore, our layout should be persistent and look great.
